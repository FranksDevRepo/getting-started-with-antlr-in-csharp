# Getting started with ANTLR in CSharp

ANTLR is a great tool to quickly create parsers and help you in working with a known language or create your DSL. While the tool itself is written in Java it can also be used to generate parsers in several other languages, for instance Python, C# or Javascript (with more languages supported by the newly released 4.6 version).

If you want to use C# you can integrate ANTLR in your favorite IDE, as long as that IDE is any recent edition of Visual Studio. The runtime itself works also on Mono, and can be used as a standalone and you can look at the issues for the official C# target for ANTLR 4 to see if you can make it work with other setups, but the easiest way is to use Visual Studio and the provided extension to integrate the generation of the grammar into the your C# project.
